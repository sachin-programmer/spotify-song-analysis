# 🎧 Spotify Song Emotion Analysis

Hey there! 👋  
This project is all about understanding how songs make us feel—using data.  
With the help of machine learning, I’ve built a system that predicts the *emotion* of a Spotify song just by looking at its audio features.



## 🔍 What's This About?

Ever wondered why some songs make you feel pumped, while others make you emotional?  
I used a dataset of nearly *50,000 songs* and trained a machine learning model to detect the *emotion* in each track.

The model looks at things like:
- 🎶 Danceability  
- 🔊 Loudness  
- 🎼 Tempo  
- 🎵 Acousticness  
- ❤ Positiveness (Valence)  
and more…

…and then predicts if the song is *happy, **sad, **calm, or **energetic*.



## 🛠 What I Did

- Cleaned and preprocessed all 18 columns of audio data
- Explored relationships between features using visualizations
- Built and trained a *Random Forest* model to classify song emotions
- Evaluated the model and tuned it for better accuracy
- (Optional) Saved the model for future use



## 📊 Tools I Used

- *Python*  
- *Pandas & NumPy* – for data handling  
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* – for charts and EDA  
- *Scikit-learn* – for training the ML model  
- *Jupyter Notebook* – for writing the entire project step-by-step

## 🚀 What’s Cool About This Project?

- You can *predict emotions* from any Spotify-style track info.
- It’s beginner-friendly and explained clearly in notebooks.
- A great intro to real-world data science and audio analysis.
- Potential use in apps like *mood-based playlist generators*.


## 💭 What's Next?

Here’s what I’d love to add in the future:
- A web app where users can upload a song and see its emotion.
- Use deep learning for better accuracy.
- Connect this with Spotify API for real-time mood detection.
